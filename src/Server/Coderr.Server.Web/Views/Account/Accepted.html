            You can find all applications in the menu top left named "Dashboard". The dashboard contains a summary for all applications
            while the drop down menu allows you to get detailed information about a specific application.

        <p>
            codeRR is based on a client/server architecture. The client packages detect and capture exceptions together
            with contextual information (such as thread info, app info etc). That information is then uploaded to our server
            for analysis.
        </p>

            To get started in a new application you need to download one of our <a href="http://nuget.org">nuget</a> packages (search for "codeRR" in the package manager).
            Feel free
            to drop us an <a href="mailto:support@codeRR.com?subject=nuget">email</a> if you need help to get started with nuget.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then visit the application by clicking on the "Dashboard" drop down to get the correct appKey/sharedSecret.
